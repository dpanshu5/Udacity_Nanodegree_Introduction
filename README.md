This analysis is focused on a data obtained from a survey in May-June 2021 in India about the psychological impact of second wave of COVID-19 on the Indian population. Three main questions which we aim to get from our analysis:

1. To identify whether Depression, Anxiety or Stress is the most prevelant
2. To find out the level of severity of the mental health issues
3. To identify which mental health problem is having the most severity across people

A standard questionnaire (DASS 21) was used in the survey which helped in calculating the level of severity of each mental health issue i.e., Anxiety, Depression and Stress (please find its link below)

To analyze the data, latest versions of the following libraries are used:

pandas
seaborn
re
matplotlib

Ensure that the data files are in the same folder as the jupyter notebook, and then "Run all" would allow to execute the complete notebook.
